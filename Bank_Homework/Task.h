Create Bank class with credit, debit and getBalance functions

Notes for the debit function:
Withdraw money from the account and ensure that the debit amount does not exceed the account's balance. 
If it does, the balance should be left unchanged and the function should print a message: "Debit amount exceeded account balance."
